With the use of clustering, I plan on grouping players based off their “type” of player. In
a similar project done by Alex Cheng, the 8 categories that players were grouped into were:
Offensive Centers, Combo Guards, Shooting Wings, Floor Generals, Versatile Forwards,
Scoring Wings, 3-and-D Wings, and Defensive Centers2
. Generating similar clusters allow the
projections to be based off each specific cluster, and not as much the whole data set, while also
giving the user a more useful guide to how players earn their fantasy points and their style of
play
